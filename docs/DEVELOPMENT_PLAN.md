### **Partially Complete (Phases 5-6)** üîÑ
- **Replay System**: Tick-by-tick execution works, entity destruction fixed, but win conditions need implementation
- **Game Rules**: Collision detection works, but scoring and win conditions not yet implemented

### **Critical Issues to Fix** üö®
1. **Win Conditions**: 8 echoes and 10 points win conditions not implemented
2. **Scoring System**: Point tracking and display not implemented
3. **Echo Preview System**: Real-time preview of other echoes during action assignment
4. **Back Button**: Ability to undo/change actions during assignment

### **Recently Fixed** ‚úÖ
1. **Entity Destruction**: Destroyed echoes now properly removed from future phases
2. **Action Misassignment**: Fixed bug where actions were incorrectly applied to wrong echoes after destruction
3. **Simulation Termination**: Fixed replay stopping early due to incorrect action calculation
4. **Echo Preview System**: Semi-transparent rendering of ally echoes during action assignment
5. **Shield Deactivation**: Fixed shield mechanics to properly deactivate after blocking a projectile
6. **Consecutive Shield Prevention**: Prevent shield action from appearing if last action was shield
7. **Shield Block Animation**: Green explosion animation positioned at tile edge where projectile hit shield

### **Next Priority: Complete Echo Preview System** üîß
1. **Projectile trail visualization** for ally previews
2. **Potential collision indicators** to show dangerous areas
3. **Move restriction** to prevent selecting tiles that would cause ally collisions

### **Future Priority: Implement Core Game Rules** üîß
1. **Implement win condition checking** and game end detection
2. **Add scoring system** for destroyed echoes
3. **Add back button functionality** for action editing

### **Game Balance & Mechanics Improvements** üîß
1. **Shield Mechanics Rebalancing** ‚úÖ:
   - Shield deactivates after blocking a projectile (not permanent) ‚úÖ
   - Prevent shield action for 2 consecutive turns after using shield ‚úÖ
   - Shield action should not appear as option if last action was shield ‚úÖ
2. **Action Point Balance**: Review costs and limits for better gameplay
3. **Collision System**: Fine-tune destruction and interaction rules
4. **Movement Balance**: Review walk/dash costs and effectiveness

### **Current Game Features** üéÆ
- ‚úÖ 8x8 tactical board with proper labeling
- ‚úÖ Echo placement and action assignment (new echoes and extend echoes)
- ‚úÖ All 5 action types with proper costs and validation
- ‚úÖ Basic replay system with collision detection
- ‚úÖ Shield mechanics and directional protection (fully balanced)
- ‚úÖ Turn-based gameplay with phase transitions
- ‚úÖ Extend Echo functionality with proper tick numbering
- ‚úÖ Entity destruction and lifecycle management (recently fixed)
- ‚úÖ Echo Preview System with semi-transparent ally rendering
- ‚úÖ Shield block animations with edge positioning and green particles
- üîÑ Win conditions (not yet implemented)
- üîÑ Scoring system (not yet implemented)

This plan provides a clear roadmap for building Echoes from concept to completion! The core mechanics and input system are now fully functional, with extend echo feature working correctly. Entity destruction and action assignment have been fixed. Echo Preview System is implemented and working well. Next priorities are completing the Echo Preview System features and implementing game balance improvements, particularly shield mechanics rebalancing.
